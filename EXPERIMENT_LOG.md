# Vibe Coding Experiment Log

> AI-assisted translation of Python algorithms to Zig (0.15.2), recording success rates and failure patterns.

## Phase 1: Spike (5 algorithms)

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.6
**Go/No-Go Result:** Go (5/5 first-attempt pass, threshold was 4/5)

### linear_search — 2026-02-27

- AI attempts to compile: **1** (first attempt passed)
- Error types: None
- Manual fix lines: **0**
- Test cases: 7, all passed
- Notes: Simplest algorithm. Used Zig's `for (items, 0..)` indexed iteration — idiomatic and clean.

### bubble_sort — 2026-02-27

- AI attempts to compile: **1** (first attempt passed)
- Error types: None
- Manual fix lines: **0**
- Test cases: 5, all passed
- Notes: Direct translation from Python. `while (i < n) : (i += 1)` maps naturally to Python's `for i in range(n)`.

### insertion_sort — 2026-02-27

- AI attempts to compile: **1** (first attempt passed)
- Error types: None
- Manual fix lines: **0**
- Test cases: 6, all passed
- Notes: Key Zig difference: `and` instead of `&&` for boolean logic. `usize` decrement in the inner loop requires care but no special handling since the `j > 0` guard runs first.

### binary_search — 2026-02-27

- AI attempts to compile: **1** (first attempt passed)
- Error types: None
- Manual fix lines: **0**
- Test cases: 9, all passed
- Notes: Returned `?usize` (optional) instead of Python's `-1` convention — more idiomatic Zig. Added `mid == 0` guard to prevent `usize` underflow on `high = mid - 1`.

### merge_sort — 2026-02-27

- AI attempts to compile: **1** (first attempt passed)
- Error types: None
- Manual fix lines: **0**
- Test cases: 7, all passed
- Notes: First algorithm requiring `std.mem.Allocator`. Used `testing.allocator` in tests (catches memory leaks automatically). `defer allocator.free()` pattern for RAII-style cleanup.

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total algorithms | 5 |
| Total test cases | 34 |
| First-attempt pass rate | 5/5 (100%) |
| Total manual fix lines | 0 |
| Common error types | None encountered |

### Key Observations

1. **Pure-logic algorithms translate cleanly.** No dynamic memory = no allocator hassle = high AI success rate.
2. **Zig idioms the AI got right:** `?usize` optionals, `comptime T: type` generics, `testing.expectEqualSlices`, `defer` for cleanup.
3. **Anticipated challenge for Phase 2:** Algorithms requiring `Allocator` (merge sort was a preview). The AI needs explicit prompting about Zig 0.15's unmanaged `ArrayList` changes.
